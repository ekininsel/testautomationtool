# testautomationtool
This is the senior project for Ozyegin University Computer Science department made by Ekin Insel and Ugur Temir.
This projet will be about test generation tool.
The first step that we did is parsing the code by using JavaParser and printing the names of the methods and parameters of those parameters and also the start line and finish line of those methods.
MethodPrinter.java class uses the javaparser and find the methods in the Math.java class and print them with other informations.
Other classes are not connected to the project they are just for understanding the javaparser and how it works. They are taken from github projects for understanding javaparser examples.
